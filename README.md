Honeywell Galaxy Flex v3.50  - SIA Alarm Receiver 

A simple script to receive messages in SIA format from the Galaxy Flex IP communicator board and display on screen.  This code is worthy of being re written and tidied up by someone who is a real programmer, as it was simply put together and edited on the fly during development as I am not a professional programmer.

Ensure the panel is not transmitting in encrypted mode.  Otherwise the ACK response will not work.
